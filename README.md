2048 Game Project
In this project I created a game named “2048” which is a single-player sliding tile puzzle video game.
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with number 2048.
I used Frame, Label & CENTER widgets from tkinter module of Python.
